  <h2 style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px;">âœ¦ genetic terminology</h2>
  <p style="font-family:Arial;padding:10px 200px">
    <br><b>gene:</b> a segment of DNA that codes for a specific trait.
    <br><b>allele:</b> an allele is a form of a gene, typically represented by letters, ie. "A" or "a". each parent gets one allele.
    <br><b>genotype:</b> the full representation of one's genes and alleles. for example, a full genotype might look like "AABbCCddEe". the genotype for
    a single trait may only look like "aa" or "Cc".
    <br><b>phenotype:</b> the physical expression of a gene or allele. these can be seen by the naked eye. a rat's phenotype might be a dumbo hooded agouti, or a rex russian blue.
    <br>
    <br><b>locus / loci:</b> the specific spot on a chromosome where the gene is located. for example, the hooded locus determines whether a rat could be hoodied, berkshire, or
    self.
    <br><b>chromosome:</b> where genetic information is stored. rats have 42 chromosomes!
    <br><b>homozygous:</b> when an individual has two alleles of the same gene. for example, "AA" or "bb".
    <br><b>heterozygous:</b> when an individual has two different alleles of the same gene. for example, "Aa" or "Bb".
    <br>
    <br><b>dominance:</b> (or complete dominance) is when an allele masks the presentation of another gene. for example, "AA" or "Aa" (agouti) masks the physical expression of "aa" (black).
    "A" is the dominant allele, so as long as it is present, it'll "override" any other alleles. dominant genes cannot be carried.
    <br><b>semi-dominance:</b> in a heterozygous pair of alleles, both alleles will be expressed. "Re/re" will present as rex, while homozygous ("Re/Re" or "re/re") will only
    present a single phenotype.
    <br><b>recessiveness:</b> genes that are "overwritten" by dominant genes. they only appear when homozygous (ex. "aa"). these genes can be carried. a rat with the genotype
    of "Aa" can produce both agouti and black offspring, since black is a recessive gene.
    <br>
    <br><b>epistatic allele:</b> a gene that can mask or suppress the expression of a different gene, commonly on a different locus..
    <br><b>hypostatic allele:</b> a gene that is masked or suppressed by the presence of an epistatic allele.
