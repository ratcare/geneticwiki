  <h2 style="font-family:Arial;padding:10px 200px">âœ¦ aggression and it's ties with genetics</h2>
  <p style="font-family:Arial;padding:10px 200px;text-indent: 50px;"> aggression is a very hot topic in the fancy, and it comes in different forms. the view on aggression typically
    differs depending where you are and who you ask. some countries have different ideas on what <i>is</i> aggression and how to deal with it. whoever you are, you've
    definitely heard some sort of myth or misinformation surrounding aggression and undesirable behavior. </p>
  <h6>what is aggression?</h6>
  <p style="font-family:Arial;padding:10px 200px;text-indent: 50px;"><b>aggression</b> is when a rat shows intent to harm a person or another rat through negative physical
    interaction. when a rat bites you and draws blood, that's aggression. a rat lunging and nipping at you with the intent to harm you is aggression. it is possible for rats to
    accidentally bite and draw blood (for example, a rat gets too excited for food and accidentally grabs your finger through the bars) but usually, this doesn't happen. rats have very good bite
    control and won't draw blood unless they want to. it's important to see aggression as what it is, instead of making excuses on why you think your rat may have bitten you. it's
    important to produce pet-grade rats when breeding, regardless of your purpose with them. in wild rats, their flight or fight response tells them to flee or bite when presented
    with a stressful stimulus. pet rats have been bred to remove this natural response. they don't have this "fight" instinct. we've learned that aggression is genetic, it's something
    that can only be bred out through selective breeding. because aggression is genetic, it cannot be trained out. aggression in rats is unlike aggression in other animals, like
    cats or dogs. an aggressive rat will always have the instinct to bite, even if they stop biting to a specific stimulus. a rat might stop biting when you stick their hand in
    the cage, but they might start again when taken to a new environment, like the vet.
