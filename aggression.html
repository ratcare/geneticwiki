  <h2 style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px;text-indent: 50px;">âœ¦ aggression and it's ties with genetics</h2>
  <p style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px;text-indent: 50px;"> aggression is a very hot topic in the fancy, and it comes in different forms. the view on aggression typically
    differs depending where you are and who you ask. some countries have different ideas on what <i>is</i> aggression and how to deal with it. whoever you are, you've
    definitely heard some sort of myth or misinformation surrounding aggression and undesirable behavior. </p>
  <h4 style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px;">what is aggression?</h6>
  <p style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px;text-indent: 50px;"><b>aggression</b> is when a rat shows intent to harm a person or another rat through negative physical
    interaction. when a rat bites you and draws blood, that's aggression. a rat lunging and nipping at you with the intent to harm you is aggression. it is possible for rats to
    accidentally bite and draw blood (for example, a rat gets too excited for food and accidentally grabs your finger through the bars) but usually, this doesn't happen. rats have very good bite
    control and won't draw blood unless they want to. it's important to see aggression as what it is, instead of making excuses on why you think your rat may have bitten you. it's
    important to produce pet-grade rats when breeding, regardless of your purpose with them. in wild rats, their flight or fight response tells them to flee or bite when presented
    with a stressful stimulus. pet rats have been bred to remove this natural response. they don't have this "fight" instinct. we've learned that aggression is genetic, it's something
    that can only be bred out through selective breeding. because aggression is genetic, it cannot be trained out. aggression in rats is unlike aggression in other animals, like
    cats or dogs. an aggressive rat will always have the instinct to bite, even if they stop biting to a specific stimulus. by training them to stop biting to a specific stressor,
    you're masking the aggression, the same way you mask your natural hair color when you dye it. the aggression will always be there. a rat might stop biting when you stick their
    hand in the cage, but they might start again when taken to a new environment, like the vet.</p>
  <h4 style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px;">what do you do with an aggressive rat?</h4>
  <p style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px;text-indent: 50px;">it's basic knowledge that rats cannot be housed alone, so isolating a rat when they show aggression is not
    a valid "fix" for aggression. because aggression cannot be fully trained out, that's not a valid solution either, since the aggression can resurface at any time. ignoring
    aggression cannot be excused due to the damage that rats can do with their teeth. a well-aimed bite can kill any other rat, and can also sever nerves in your hands (or worse).
    therefore, the best thing to do with an aggressive rat is putting them to sleep. it's the most humane thing you can do for them, as long as you don't give them a gruesome
    death. an aggressive rat is not a happy one, especially if it's isolated. as a breeder, breeding against aggression is one of your main goals. by selling aggressive rats, 
    you will be liable if that rat kills or hurts their cagemate, or damages someone's hand. this is one of the many reasons why anti-cull breeders are unethical.</p>
