  <h2 style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px">âœ¦ genetic health issues</h2>
  <p style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px"> health issues is the major reason why selective breeding is a thing that exists. by selecting for healthy rats that show
    no health problems and have desirable temperaments, you're creating pet-grade rats. there are quite a few traits related by health that are tied for genetics. by not
    selecting against unhealthy traits, you're compromising not only your future rats, but any generation of rats you may keep in the future.</p>
  <h4 style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px">undesirable genetic traits</h4>
  <ul style="font-family:Arial;padding:0px 200px">
    <li><b>susceptibity to tumors:</b> likeliness of getting tumors (mammary, pituitary, etc.) is linked to genetics. good, established lines from established breeders
      have lower chances of developing tumors.</li>
    <li><b>lower lifespans:</b> lifespan and healthspan are both things you can breed to improve, however due to the common/prime breeding age of rats,
      it's hard to learn about a rat's lifespan until far after they've breeded, and you can only attempt to predict the lifespan of a rat.</li>
    <li><b>poor immune system:</b> inability to fight off disease. this can make rats more susceptible to things such as URIs.</li>
    <li><b>obesity or diabetes:</b> this trait can be linked to genetics, however that isn't always the case. if you have a rat that shows traits consitent with
      genetic obesity or diabetes, they should be bred selectively or not at all.</li>
    <li><b>megacolon:</b> rats that have come from lines that carry megacolon should not be bred, at all. both early-onset and late-onset megacolon are not acceptable, and
      rats that actively have it should be culled. megacolon is often linked to "high whites", a pattern of white pigment that can affect the body in negative aways.</li>
    <li><b>aggression/poor temperament:</b> rats that show genetic or maternal aggression should ne culled, and not bred. rats that have hormonal aggression should not be
      bred or selectively bred against the aggression. aggression and temperament is genetic, so it's your job to minimize the risk or occurance of these traits. rats that
      have poor temperament and show things such as skittishness are not pet-grade rats.</li>
